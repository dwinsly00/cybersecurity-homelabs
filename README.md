# Cybersecurity Homelab – 12-Week Guided Program

This repository contains a full hands-on roadmap to practice cybersecurity in a Proxmox/VMEX homelab.
It includes weekly projects, exact exercises (adapted from provided problem statements) and extras.

## Layout
- Each week has a `README.md` (instructions) and `lab_notes.md` (raw commands, outputs, screenshots).
- Keep screenshots in the `img/` folder in each week.

## Networks (suggested)
- VLAN10 – Attacker (Kali/Parrot)
- VLAN20 – Victims (Windows, Linux web apps, Android)
- VLAN30 – Security (OpenVAS, Splunk/ELK)

> Take a snapshot before each lab.
