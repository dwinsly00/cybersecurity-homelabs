# OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanning (Week 2)

## Objective
Install and configure OpenVAS (Greenbone) on Kali to scan Windows Server 2022 and Metasploitable Linux, report CVEs, and re-scan after hardening.

## Setup (Kali/OpenVAS)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openvas
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-check-setup
# Web UI will be at https://KALI_IP:9392
```

## Targets
- Windows Server 2022 (fresh + weak baseline)
- Metasploitable 2 (intentionally vulnerable)

## Scan Steps
1. Add targets in GVM â†’ Set credentials if needed for authenticated scans.
2. Run "Full and fast" scan on both hosts.
3. Export results as PDF and CSV.
4. Prioritize remediation by CVSS score and exploitability.

## Commands (Network Recon)
```bash
nmap -A -T4 -p- WINDOWS_IP -oA scans/win_full
nmap -A -T4 -p- METASP_IP  -oA scans/meta_full
```

## Hardening & Re-Scan
- Windows: enable firewall, patch via Windows Update, disable SMBv1, enforce strong passwords.
- Linux: patch `apt upgrade`, disable unused services, enforce SSH keys.

## Deliverables
- PDF vulnerability reports (baseline & post-hardening)
- Remediation plan with timelines
